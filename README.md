# Experiments-Groups


- dataset-random-graphs: The k-reduced-skew-spectra of Erdős–Rényi graphs.
- fromsparse.py: convert g6 graphs into netnworkx->numpy and gerate k-reduced-skew-spectra
- EXP-Atlas-undirected: the experiments with all undirected graphs of n=7 nodes
- EXP-discriminating-important-graphs: our 3-reduced-skew-spectra can distringuish two important graphs :)
